# Bridge App — Claude Code Instructions

## Codebase Status

This is the **production codebase** for Bridge — the app being deployed to the App Store. It contains both the frontend (React Native/Expo) and backend (Supabase, in the `supabase/` subdirectory). Treat all code here as production-quality.

## LOCKED: Bottom Navigation Bar

The bottom nav bar values in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` (`CustomTabBar`) are **finalized and must not be changed** without explicit user instruction. Do not adjust any of the following:

- `contentHeight = Math.round(screenHeight * 0.057)` — bar height as % of screen
- `iconSize = Math.round(contentHeight * 0.65)` — icon size proportional to bar
- `iconPaddingTop = Math.round(contentHeight * 0.25)` — icon vertical placement proportional to bar
- `top: 0` on the blue indicator — keeps it flush at the top border
- Indicator dimensions: `width: 40, height: 3`, color `#437FFF`
- Active tint: `#437FFF`, inactive tint: `#667085`

These were tuned to match the Figma design and confirmed by the user. Leave them alone.

## LOCKED: Compatibility Score Display

Any compatibility percentage badge shown to users in the UI (e.g. in `ProposalReviewView`, match cards, or any future screen) **must always use the hash-based 70–99 decorative value**. Do not replace this with `proposal.compatibilityScore`, any database column, or any algorithmic output.

Rules:
- The score is **display-only and intentionally decorative** — it has no connection to the matchmaking algorithm
- It is **seeded by the proposal/match ID** so it is stable across renders and sessions for the same proposal
- Each new proposal or match gets its own fixed score derived from its ID — a new proposal always gets a new number, but that number never changes for the life of that proposal
- The formula is: `70 + (id.split('').reduce((acc, c) => acc + c.charCodeAt(0), 0) % 30)`
- The `compatibility_score` column on the `proposals` table is for internal backend/algorithm use only and must never be surfaced in the UI

This is a deliberate product decision. Do not "fix" this.

## Typography System — Plus Jakarta Sans

The entire app uses **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Google Fonts, OFL license). This is a deliberate design decision — do not switch to another font or reintroduce system fonts.

### Architecture (3 layers)

1. **`src/constants/typography.ts`** — single source of truth. Exports:
   - `FONTS` — font family constants (`regular`, `medium`, `semiBold`, `bold`, `extraBold`)
   - `FONT_SIZES` — 12-step size scale (11px–40px)
   - `LINE_HEIGHTS` — matching line-height scale
   - `TEXT_STYLES` — 18 semantic presets (display, heading, body, label, caption, button)

2. **`src/components/ui/Typography.tsx`** — shared text components (`H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `Body`, `BodySmall`, `Label`, `Caption`, `Display`). Each resolves the correct `fontFamily` from NativeWind `font-bold`/`font-semibold`/`font-medium` classes via `resolveFontFamily()`.

3. **`src/utils/setDefaultFonts.ts`** — global fallback that patches `Text.render` (or `defaultProps`) to map `fontWeight` → correct PlusJakartaSans variant. Imported in `App.tsx` after fonts load.

### Rules for new code

- **Always set `fontFamily`** when using inline styles with `fontWeight`. Use `FONTS.bold` etc., never raw strings.
- **Import `FONTS`** from `src/constants/typography` — never hardcode `'PlusJakartaSans_700Bold'` in components.
- **Typography components** handle font resolution automatically — prefer `<Body className="font-bold">` over manual fontFamily.
- **Font loading** happens in `App.tsx` via `useFonts` hook from `@expo-google-fonts/plus-jakarta-sans`. The app shows a loading indicator until fonts are ready.
- **Weight mapping**:
  - `FONTS.regular` = 400 (body text, descriptions)
  - `FONTS.medium` = 500 (labels, secondary emphasis)
  - `FONTS.semiBold` = 600 (subheadings, buttons)
  - `FONTS.bold` = 700 (headings, names)
  - `FONTS.extraBold` = 800 (hero text, large numbers)
- **Do not** use `Outfit`, `Satoshi`, `Inter`, or any other font family — these have been fully removed.
- **Do not** rely on `fontWeight` alone — React Native with custom fonts requires the specific font file via `fontFamily`.
- **Tailwind config** (`tailwind.config.js`) maps `font-sans` etc. to PlusJakartaSans variants.
